# AEA Framework Audit

Comprehensive audit of the open-aea codebase. Date: 2026-02-28.

## Production-Relevant Issues

### P1. CRITICAL — `connection_exception_policy` silently ignored ✅

`aea/aea.py:133,174` — The policy is stored in `self._connection_exception_policy` but never passed into `multiplexer_options`. The multiplexer always falls back to `propagate`, regardless of user config (`just_log`, `stop_and_exit`).

### P2. CRITICAL — `FSMBehaviour` final state detection broken ✅

`aea/skills/behaviours.py:360` — `current_state in self._final_states` compares a `State` object to a `Set[str]`. This never matches, so FSMs can never detect reaching a final state.

### P3. CRITICAL — `TickerBehaviour.last_act_time` returns wrong value ✅

`aea/skills/behaviours.py:148` — Returns `self._start_at` instead of `self._last_act_time`. Any code inspecting when the behaviour last acted gets the start time instead.

### P4. CRITICAL — `asyncio.StreamReader(loop=)` removed in Python 3.10 ✅

`aea/helpers/pipe.py:173-175` — The `loop=` parameter was removed in Python 3.10. This causes `TypeError` at runtime on all supported Python versions when `PosixNamedPipeProtocol.connect()` is called.

### P5. CRITICAL — `asyncio.ensure_future(loop=)` removed in Python 3.10 ✅

`aea/manager/manager.py:233-234` — Same as above. `AgentRunProcessTask.start()` will crash at runtime on all supported Python versions.

### P6. HIGH — Default connection validation always passes ✅

`aea/multiplexer.py:138-146` — `bool([...])` checks if the list is non-empty (always True if connections exist), not whether any element matched. Should use `any(...)`. An invalid default connection passes validation silently.

### P7. HIGH — `install_dependencies` uses wrong pip flag ✅

`aea/helpers/install_dependency.py:71` — Replaces `-i` with `--extra-index`, but the correct pip flag is `--extra-index-url`. This causes pip to error on multi-dependency installs with custom indexes.

### P8. HIGH — `merge_dependencies` checks wrong variable ✅

`aea/configurations/pypi.py:256` — `old_dep_is_simple = is_simple_dep(info)` checks the **new** dep instead of the old one. This inverts the merge logic, potentially allowing invalid merges or rejecting valid ones.

### P9. HIGH — Single connection failure kills entire receiving loop ✅

`aea/multiplexer.py:532` — `task.result()` in `_receiving_loop` re-raises exceptions from any connection's `receive()`. The outer `except` terminates the loop for **all** connections, not just the failing one.

### P10. INFO — `remove_unused_component_configurations` config dump placement

`aea/cli/remove.py:300-301` — The `open_file`/`dump` code sits after the `@contextmanager` generator's `finally` block, so it only runs on success. This is intentional: on failure no items were removed, so no disk write is needed. The `finally` block correctly restores in-memory `component_configurations`. In the rare case of partial failure during dependency removal the disk state may be stale, but moving the dump into `finally` would break existing tests and error handling.

### P11. HIGH — `Dialogue.is_self_initiated` uses identity comparison ✅

`aea/protocols/dialogue/base.py:523-525` — Uses `is not` instead of `!=` on address strings. Python does not guarantee string interning for arbitrary values, so equal addresses may still fail the identity check.

### P12. INFO — `DialogueLabel.from_str` breaks on underscores in fields

`aea/protocols/dialogue/base.py:207-220` — Uses `_` as separator in `__str__` and `split("_")` in `from_str`. Breaks if addresses or references contain underscores. Not fixable without changing `__str__`, which would break backward compatibility with persisted dialogue storage keys. `from_str` is not used in production code (only tests); production serialization uses `from_json`/`json`.

### P13. MEDIUM — `sys.stderr` permanently replaced with `/dev/null` ✅

`aea/cli/run.py:218` — After profiling stops, stderr is redirected to devnull and never restored. All subsequent error output is silenced. The file handle also leaks.

### P14. MEDIUM — Private keys written with default (world-readable) permissions (deferred)

`aea/crypto/base.py:174` — `open(private_key_file, "wb")` uses default permissions (typically `0o644`). Should use `0o600` for private key files. Deferred: changing file permissions is observable behavior that could break downstream tooling, CI/CD pipelines, or scripts that read key files as a different user.

### P15. MEDIUM — `AsyncState` not thread-safe (deferred)

`aea/helpers/async_utils.py:65-160` — Used across threads (runtime state changes from async thread, read from main thread) but has no synchronization primitives protecting `_state`, `_watchers`, or `_callbacks`. Deferred: adding locks to this core runtime primitive changes timing behavior and risks deadlocks or performance regressions. The race condition is real but rarely triggered in practice.

### P16. MEDIUM — Manager shared state modified from multiple threads without locks (deferred)

`aea/manager/manager.py` — `_agents`, `_agents_tasks`, `_projects` dicts are accessed from both main thread and background event loop thread with no mutex protection. Can cause `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`. Deferred: adding mutexes could cause deadlocks if existing code holds other locks or does blocking calls while iterating these dicts. The race condition is real but rarely triggered in practice.

### P17. MEDIUM — `_wait_for_result` crashes on `queue.Empty` ✅

`aea/manager/manager.py:242-254` — `get_nowait()` is called immediately after detecting process is dead, but the result may not yet be in the queue. Unhandled `queue.Empty` exception.

### P18. MEDIUM — `PosixNamedPipeProtocol` leaks file descriptors on retry ✅

`aea/helpers/pipe.py:157-166` — When output pipe open fails with `ENXIO`, the input fd from line 157 is never closed before recursing to retry. Each retry leaks an fd.

### P19. MEDIUM — `Message.__init__` silently swallows consistency errors (deferred)

`aea/protocols/base.py:86-89` — Consistency check failures are caught and only logged. Invalid messages are created in an inconsistent state with no programmatic way to detect the error. Deferred: raising exceptions instead of logging would break any downstream code that constructs messages with temporarily inconsistent fields. The current log-and-continue behavior is almost certainly relied upon.

### P20. MEDIUM — `re.match` for class name lookup allows partial/regex matches ✅

`aea/connections/base.py:294`, `aea/contracts/base.py:131`, `aea/protocols/base.py:393,404`, `aea/skills/base.py:766` — Class names from config are used as regex patterns with `re.match`, which doesn't require a full match. `"MyConn"` would match `"MyConnection"`. Fixed across all four component types (connections, contracts, protocols, skills). Customs are config-only and have no class loading.

### P21. MEDIUM — `MixedRegistry.check_item_present` missing early return ✅

`aea/cli/publish.py:273-293` — After successful local check, no `return` statement. Falls through to remote check. If remote registry is down but package exists locally, publish fails with misleading error.

### P22. INFO — `ItemSpec.get_class` mutates class objects via `setattr`

`aea/crypto/registries/base.py:149-158` — Every call to `get_class()` sets class-level attributes via `setattr` on the original class. If two `ItemSpec` instances reference the same class with different `class_kwargs`, the last call wins. In practice this does not occur: crypto plugins register distinct classes, and contracts have a re-registration guard. Fixing this (e.g. via dynamic subclassing) would change `type(instance) is OriginalClass` identity checks, breaking downstream code that relies on exact type matching. Left as-is for consistency and backward compatibility.

### P23. MEDIUM — No thread safety in component registries ✅

`aea/registries/base.py:337-367` — Non-atomic read-unregister-modify-register pattern with no locking. Dynamic component registration can lose updates under concurrent access.

### P24. INFO — `ProtectedQueue.put` ignores caller-supplied `block` and `timeout`

`aea/decision_maker/base.py:182` — Hard-codes `block=True, timeout=None` regardless of caller arguments. Likely intentional: the `ProtectedQueue` ensures messages between skills and the decision maker are never silently dropped. The method signature is misleading (accepts `block`/`timeout` but ignores them), but changing the behavior risks dropping messages in production. `put_nowait` exists as a separate path for non-blocking puts.

### P25. LOW — `BaseException` catch converts Ctrl-C to ClickException (deferred)

`aea/cli/remove.py:425` — Makes it impossible to interrupt a removal operation with Ctrl-C. Deferred: changing exception handling flow in CLI commands could affect downstream error handling, exit codes, or cleanup logic.

### P26. LOW — `Dependency.from_json` does not preserve `extras` (deferred)

`aea/configurations/data_types.py:937-953` — `extras` not in `allowed_keys`. Round-tripping through JSON loses extras information. Deferred: adding `extras` to serialization changes output that downstream tools may parse or compare, and could affect package hash generation.

## Developer Experience (DevX) Issues

### D1. HIGH — `logging.getLogger(__file__)` instead of `__name__` ✅

`aea/helpers/async_utils.py:48`, `aea/helpers/profiling.py:45`, `aea/helpers/exec_timeout.py:35` — Creates logger names like `/Users/.../async_utils.py` instead of `aea.helpers.async_utils`. Breaks the standard Python logging hierarchy — configuring logging for `aea.helpers` won't affect these loggers.

### D2. HIGH — Imports from private `concurrent.futures._base` ✅

`aea/runtime.py:24`, `aea/multiplexer.py:26-27` — Importing `CancelledError` and `TimeoutError` from a private module risks breakage in future Python versions. Replaced with `asyncio.CancelledError` and `asyncio.TimeoutError` (same classes since Python 3.9+).

### D3. HIGH — `suppress(Exception, asyncio.CancelledError)` swallows all errors during shutdown ✅

`aea/multiplexer.py:365-366, 377-378` — All exceptions were silently swallowed with no logging. Replaced with explicit try/except that passes on `CancelledError` (expected during shutdown) but logs other exceptions via `logger.exception`.

### D4. HIGH — `resp_json["detail"]` crashes on HTTP 500 with non-JSON body ✅

`aea/cli/registry/utils.py:103-117` — If server returns 500 with non-JSON body, `resp_json` is `None` and `resp_json["detail"]` raises `TypeError` instead of a meaningful error. Also fixed same pattern for 409 responses.

### D5. MEDIUM — 17+ uses of deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` (deferred)

Multiple files — Emits `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.10+ when no running loop exists. Should use `asyncio.get_running_loop()` in async contexts or explicit `asyncio.new_event_loop()` elsewhere. Deferred: scattered across many files, each call site needs individual analysis (async vs sync context). High chance of subtle regressions.

### D6. MEDIUM — `inspect.stack()` called on every `PersistDialoguesStorage` init (deferred)

`aea/protocols/dialogue/base.py:1057-1068` — Expensive operation that captures all frames and prevents garbage collection of local variables. Performance bottleneck with many dialogues. Deferred: fixing requires passing the skill component explicitly rather than introspecting the stack, which changes the constructor's public API.

### D7. MEDIUM — Class-level mutable defaults in `BaseAEATestCase` (deferred)

`aea/test_tools/test_cases.py:120-135` — `subprocesses`, `threads`, `agents` are shared mutable class defaults. Can leak between test classes if setup/teardown discipline isn't followed. Deferred: changing to instance-level initialization could break subclasses in downstream projects that access these before setup runs or override them at class level.

### D8. MEDIUM — `asyncio.Queue()` outside event loop in `BaseSkillTestCase` (deferred)

`aea/test_tools/test_skill.py:507-509` — Deprecated in Python 3.10+. Emits warnings or fails in newer Python versions. Deferred: this is in test tooling used by downstream projects. Changing queue creation could break test setup patterns in dependent projects.

### D9. INFO — `_load_state` breaks on first project failure

`aea/manager/manager.py:1072-1093` — Uses `break` instead of `continue` when a project fails to load, skipping remaining projects. Likely intentional fail-fast behavior: subsequent projects may depend on the failed one, and continuing could cause cascading errors or inconsistent state. The `failed_to_load` list is returned to the caller to handle.

### D10. MEDIUM — `_set_executor_pool` ignores its `max_workers` parameter ✅

`aea/connections/base.py:380-388` — Parameter immediately overwritten by config value on the next line. Fixed to use `max_workers` as fallback when config does not specify `max_thread_workers`.

### D11. LOW — Dead code: Python < 3.7 compatibility branches

`aea/protocols/dialogue/base.py:55-70` — Unreachable since the project requires Python 3.10+.

### D12. LOW — Typos in code

- `aea/multiplexer.py:133` — `"os out of"` should be `"is out of"`
- `aea/multiplexer.py:235` — `"multipelxer"` should be `"multiplexer"`
- `aea/cli/utils/exceptions.py:30` — Function named `aev_flag_depreaction` should be `deprecation`; message has `"envrionment varibales"` should be `"environment variables"`
- `aea/configurations/manager.py:356` — `substitude_env_vars` should be `substitute_env_vars` (public API, breaking to rename)

### D13. LOW — Stale deprecation warning claims removal in v2.0.0

`aea/cli/utils/exceptions.py:30-33` — The `--aev` flag deprecation message says "will be removed in v2.0.0" but the current version is 2.1.0rc2.

### D14. LOW — `clean_tarfiles` removes ALL `.tar.gz` files in CWD

`aea/cli/registry/utils.py:238-259` — Not scoped to the file created by the decorated function.

### D15. LOW — Copy-paste docstring errors

`aea/skills/base.py:658-665` — Both `behaviours` and `models` properties say "Get the handlers."

### D16. LOW — `--aev` flag value hardcoded to `True`

`aea/cli/run.py:156` — `--aev` flag exists on CLI but `apply_environment_variables` is always passed as `True`. Misleading interface.

### D17. LOW — `AgentRunProcessTask._run_agent` — `aea` may be unbound in finally

`aea/manager/manager.py:269-303` — If `get_aea_instance()` raises, `aea.logger.debug(...)` in the finally block causes `NameError`.
